# Build-a-DEX-Using-JavaScript

In this project, I built a crypto decentralized exchange. This exchange allows users to connect it to their Metamask (a crypto software wallet), get a quote on the wanted amount of a crypto coin, and buy it. 

__API__

The price of different coins are fetched from the API of Coinpaprika (https://api.coinpaprika.com/) using async function, await and fetch . 

__Asynchronous programming__

- Since an exchange involves fetching data from another website, asynchronous programming is used. the below functions are part of asynchronous programming:
- Getting coins data from the API of Coinpaprika
- Log in and log out
- Buying crypto coins
- Submitting form to get a quote
- Canceling form
- Getting a quote from one crypto to another
